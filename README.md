# SmartSpend - Financial Advisor App

SmartSpend is an innovative financial advisor application developed during the Eestech Challenge Hackathon, a 24-hour event focused on creating unique business ideas. The key challenge was to create an application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for educational purposes.

## About the App
SmartSpend helps you manage your finances by allowing you to enter your income, expenses, and financial goals. The app provides personalized tips and advice for better spending and saving money. Additionally, SmartSpend includes an integrated chat feature where you can ask questions to an LLM-powered assistant for financial guidance.

SmartSpend also offers graphical representations of your spending habits, making it easier to visualize where your money goes. The LLM is capable of categorizing your expenses based on the names you enter, providing a clearer picture of your financial activities. The app's design is modern and functional, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Important Notes
SmartSpend was developed during a 24-hour hackathon, so some features may not be fully completed. However, all key features are functional.

## Backend and Frontend
- The backend of SmartSpend is written in Python and uses the Llama 2 Large Language Model. During development, it was running on AWS EC2 instances, but it can also be configured to run locally. This flexibility allows you to experiment with different setups, depending on your resources and needs.
- The frontend is developed using Android Studio with Java, designed to be modern and functional, and providing a seamless user experience.

## Future Plans
In the future, we aim to discuss with banks to see if they would like to integrate SmartSpend into their mobile banking applications. This would allow users to benefit from SmartSpend's features directly within their banking apps.
